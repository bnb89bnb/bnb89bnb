In the fast-paced software development field, efficiency is life. Today, we will explore a revolliary tool-CodeBuddy, which is leading the change of development mode. CodeBuddy is not only a simple code editor, but also an intelligent assistant that can significantly improve the development efficiency. This paper will deeply analyze the core functions of CodeBuddy, especially its powerful ability to generate applications with one click. Imagine that CodeBuddy can build a complete application framework for you in just one sentence, and bid farewell to the troubles of spending a lot of time on simple applications in the past. We will analyze step by step how CodeBuddy understands your requirements, and turn it into operational code, so that you can experience the convenience and efficiency of intelligent development.

One-sentence generation application
As shown in the figure below, select Chat mode in CodeBuddy and enter your own requirements:

The requirements are as follows: bnb89Use Vue 3+Vite+Elementiplus technology stack to realize an electronic photo album project.


Then follow the generated tips to develop applications, and truly realize the brainless development mode.

Analytical responsebnb89
When we put forward our own requirements, CodeBuddy returned the corresponding content to us, and then we can develop according to the prompts. This process is not explained too much.
We mainly analyze the rationality of the response content.

Project creation
As shown in the figure below:
In CodeBuddy's reply, vue's project was created according to our needs, and at the same time, the installation of the ui framework that we need to use was not forgotten.



There are problems:
There is a pit developer to pay attention to during the experience:


For all commands that need to be executed at the terminal, it is not recommended to directly apply. If the terminal type selected by default in the direct apply model may not meet the personal development needs, it is recommended to directly copy the command execution.

Project structure display
As shown in the following figure, the model also gives the directory structure of the project in the process of reply. At this time, developers can understand their own projects more clearly, which also provides a reference basis for the next development.



Core code implementation bnb89
After the project structure is displayed, it will be the content of the core code area. We just need to copy = "Create file/folder =" and paste it according to the prompts. As shown in the figure below, there is a path prompt in front of each code block, which needs attention, because the created project may not change the folder or file.



Follow the prompts of the core code to copy and paste.

Project operation bnb89
When all the operations are completed according to the prompts, we run the project to see the effect.
The effect is as follows:



Obviously, the running effect at this time does not really run our project, but the default framework project. www.bnb89.com

summary
Judging from the content of the model reply, the idea is clear and won't confuse the developers, but the final operation effect is problematic. I think it may be that there is less relevant training, but it doesn't matter. In the next chapter, we will explain how to deal with this situation.
